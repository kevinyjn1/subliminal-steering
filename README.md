# Steering the Subliminal

Exploring **subliminal learning in Large Language Models (LLMs)** and whether hidden traits can be **detected, understood, and controlled** with steering vectors.

---

## ðŸ“‘ Research Proposal (Gist)

Recent work shows that LLMs can **subliminally acquire traits** (e.g., preferences) when fine-tuned on semantically unrelated data.  
The effect is real, but the **mechanism is unknown** â€” raising important questions for AI safety and alignment.

This project investigates:

- **Where** subliminal traits are encoded (layers, heads, MLPs).  
- **How** they propagate internally, using mechanistic interpretability tools such as activation patching, task vectors, and sparse autoencoders.  
- **Whether** they can be **controlled** at inference time with **steering vectors**, without modifying model weights.  

**Goal:** Show that subliminal traits can be isolated as **low-dimensional vectors** that can be **enhanced, suppressed, or erased** safely and predictably.
